# Mental Health Prediction Project ðŸ§ 

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to seek treatment for mental health issues based on survey responses. It demonstrates the **end-to-end ML lifecycle**, from preprocessing and model comparison to deployment with a user-friendly interface.

---

## Objective

The goal is to create an ML-based system that predicts mental health treatment likelihood using a **public survey dataset**.  
**Note:** This is for educational/demo purposes only â€” **not medical advice**.

---

## Dataset

* Source: `survey.csv` (employee workplace & personal survey)
* Target variable: `treatment` (Yes/No â€” whether the person sought treatment)
* Features: ~26 columns including demographics (Age, Gender, Country), workplace factors (remote work, company size, supervisor support), and perception-based responses (benefits, anonymity, wellness programs, etc.)

---

## Preprocessing

* **Imputation**: Missing values handled (`SimpleImputer`) â€” median for numeric, most frequent for categorical
* **Encoding**: Categorical variables encoded using `OrdinalEncoder` with `handle_unknown='use_encoded_value'`
* **ColumnTransformer**: Combines numeric + categorical preprocessing for consistent transformations

---

## Model Training

Multiple models were trained and compared:

* Logistic Regression  
* Decision Tree  
* Random Forest  
* Extra Trees  
* K-Nearest Neighbors  
* Gaussian Naive Bayes  
* Linear Discriminant Analysis  
* SVC (RBF kernel)  
* AdaBoost  
* LightGBM  

Each wrapped in a **scikit-learn pipeline** with preprocessing included.

---

## Evaluation

Metrics used:

* Accuracy  
* Precision (weighted)  
* Recall (weighted)  
* F1-score (weighted)  

**Results**:

* LightGBM: best overall accuracy  
* AdaBoost: strong recall/F1 performance  

---

## Deployment

* **Pipeline saved**: `mh_pipeline.pkl` (preprocessing + model) via `cloudpickle`  
* **Metadata saved**: `meta.json` (feature columns, target variable)  
* Streamlit app (`app.py`) collects user input, predicts treatment likelihood, and displays results with **ethical disclaimers**

---

## Technical Stack

* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, LightGBM, cloudpickle  
* **Streamlit**: UI deployment  
* **Git/GitHub**: Version control  
* **Virtual Environment (venv)**: Reproducibility  

---

## Key Learnings

* Building reusable ML pipelines (preprocessing + modeling)  
* Comparing multiple ML algorithms with various metrics  
* Handling real-world survey data (missing values, categorical encoding, imbalanced labels)  
* Deploying ML models with a user-friendly interface  
* Awareness of AI ethics in sensitive domains like mental health
